                <h2>Santa Marta, Colombia</h2>
                <p>Embark on a breathtaking journey to Santa Marta, where nature meets history. Nestled between the Caribbean Sea and the Sierra Nevada mountain range, Santa Marta offers diverse landscapes and rich cultural experiences.</p>

                <h2>Places to Visit</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Playa Blanca:</strong> Here we rent a jet ski for two hours and explore the whole island. We saw some coral reefs and a huge variety of endemic fishes</li>
                    <li><strong>Tayrona National Park:</strong> In this place, we saw like 21 beaches each more beautiful than the other. The water was like crystal; we could see our reflection in it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tayrona Gold Museum:</strong> In the museum, we saw a lot of this society's art pieces made of gold. It is amazing how they manipulate the gold with the technology limitations.</li>

                <h2>Local Cuisine Exploration</h2>
                <p>I'm a really big fan of seafood, that's why I enjoyed this trip so much. Basically, as we were on the coast of Colombia, we "had to" have fish for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with coconut rice, patacon, and aguapanela as a drink.</p>

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>I really enjoy this trip and not only because we were on the beach, eating delicious food and enjoying the amazing Colombian culture but mainly because I was with my family before leaving the country.</p>

                <h2>Funny Moments</h2>
                <p>This happened at night, so we wanted to buy a "Coco Loco" that is basically a coconut filled up with multiple types of liquours but it was so expensive and I had to go up in the stage to sign and dance to get one for free.</p>
